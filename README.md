# Real-Estate-Scraper
Reads files from the provided xlsx and searches for those terms on Zillow.
Scrapes and writes output to a new xlsx.
All in Python using Selenium.
There is probably a more elegant way to bundle all the try/catch statements which I will implement later. I also think Beautiful Soup may be better but was having difficulty changing search terms and sending the correct requests.
